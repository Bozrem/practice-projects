A collection of smaller projects that I use to practice a specific skill

Small terminal-based calculators written in different languages
Take in a terminal input containing numbers, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction and prints the result
Uses Regular Expressions for input formatting, and uses a recursive calculate function to simulate the order of operations
